`ContinuumSensitivityOptimizer.sh`: Example script for how to obtain optimized cuts and expected sensitivity in wide energy bins.

`parseSensitivity.py`: Script to extract effective area, bg rates, sensitivity from log files produced in the previous step.

Note: Both scripts have hardcoded paths/filenames, check comments to see what needs to be edited.
